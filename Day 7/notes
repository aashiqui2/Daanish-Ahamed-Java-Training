#String-immutable.string buffer.string builder
when string objects needs to be modified  very often we should not use string objects


#stringbuffer-java.lang-mutable class - synchronised class
we cannot make the string literal as mutal by using the string buffer
'StringBuffer sb ="abc";'


#synchronized
a thread safe mutable sequence of char Astring buffer is like a String but can be modified

#string buffer is thread safe
All methods are synchronized methods

#string Builder-non synchronized class-java.lang
-mutable class-JDK 1.5->
a mutable sequence of a characters this class provides an api comptible with stringbuffer
but with no gurantee of synchronized.

String Builder is not threat safe.
all methods are not synchronised
